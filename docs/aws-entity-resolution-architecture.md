   - Real-time lookups via API

1. **S3 Output Bucket**

   - Stores match results with unique identifiers
   - Maintains resolution history
   - Supports encrypted storage of matched data

### Integration Components

1. **API Gateway**[³](#references)

   - Provides RESTful interface for real-time resolution
   - Supports authenticated access from applications
   - Enables GetMatchId functionality

1. **Lambda Functions**[⁴](#references)

   - Pre-processing data transformation
   - Post-processing result enrichment
   - Custom matching rule execution
   - Integration with downstream systems

1. **Step Functions**[⁵](#references)

   - Orchestrates end-to-end matching workflows
   - Coordinates batch processing jobs
   - Handles error conditions and retries
   - Triggers notifications on completion

### Security Components

1. **KMS Key Management**[⁶](#references)

   - Centralized encryption key management
   - Encryption of data at rest and in transit
   - Key rotation and access controls

1. **IAM Roles and Policies**[⁷](#references)

   - Least-privilege access model
   - Service role for Entity Resolution
   - Data access policies for input/output buckets
   - API authentication and authorization

1. **Data Protection Features**[²](#references)

   - Support for hashed PII data
   - Regional data processing
   - Audit logging of all resolution activities

### Monitoring and Observability

1. **CloudWatch Integration**[⁸](#references)

   - Operational metrics collection
   - Performance monitoring
   - Alerting on error conditions
   - Log aggregation and analysis

1. **Custom Dashboards**

   - Match quality metrics
   - Processing volume trends
   - Error rate monitoring
   - Data quality indicators

## Data Flow

### Batch Resolution Process

1. Source systems export data to AWS Glue tables or S3 buckets
1. AWS Entity Resolution reads data using configured schema mappings
1. Matching workflows execute based on defined rules or ML models
1. Match results are written to S3 output bucket with unique match IDs
1. Downstream systems consume match results for business processes

### Real-time Resolution Process

1. Application sends entity attributes via API call
1. AWS Entity Resolution applies normalization and matching rules
1. Service returns match ID if entity matches existing records
1. Application uses match ID to retrieve or update entity information
1. CloudWatch logs and metrics capture resolution activity

## Implementation Considerations

### Data Preparation

- Consistent primary keys across source systems
- Data quality assessment and remediation
- Normalization of key attributes (names, addresses, etc.)
- Handling of missing or incomplete data

### Performance Optimization

- Partitioning large datasets for parallel processing
- Incremental processing for high-volume sources
- Strategic use of real-time vs. batch resolution
- Caching strategies for frequently resolved entities

### Integration Strategy

- Initial bulk matching for historical data
- Incremental updates for ongoing changes
- Event-driven resolution for real-time use cases
- Feedback loops for match quality improvement

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (1-3 months)

- Establish AWS Entity Resolution infrastructure
- Configure security controls and access policies
- Implement initial schema mappings for primary data sources
- Develop and test basic matching workflows

### Phase 2: Core Use Cases (3-6 months)

- Implement Customer 360 use case
- Integrate with key operational systems
- Establish monitoring and quality metrics
- Refine matching rules based on feedback

### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities (6-12 months)

## Conclusion

The proposed AWS Entity Resolution architecture provides a scalable, secure, and
flexible foundation for resolving entity data across our organization. By leveraging the
managed service capabilities of AWS, we can implement entity resolution with minimal
infrastructure management while achieving high performance and reliability.

This architecture supports our key use cases while providing a path for future expansion
and enhancement of our entity resolution capabilities.
