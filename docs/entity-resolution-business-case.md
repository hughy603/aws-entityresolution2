# Entity Resolution: Business Case for Implementation

## Executive Summary

This business case outlines the strategic value, return on investment (ROI), and
implementation considerations for adopting an entity resolution solution. By
implementing entity resolution technology, our organization can create unified, accurate
views of customers, products, and other critical entities across disparate systems –
driving significant improvements in customer experience, operational efficiency, risk
management, and revenue growth.

Industry benchmarks indicate that organizations implementing entity resolution solutions
can achieve:

- 15-30% reduction in duplicate customer records[¹](#references)
- 25-40% improvement in marketing campaign effectiveness[²](#references)
- 20-35% reduction in customer onboarding time[³](#references)
- 15-25% increase in cross-sell/upsell conversion rates
- 30-50% reduction in false positives for fraud detection[⁴](#references)

## Business Challenge

Our organization currently faces several critical data challenges that directly impact
business performance:

1. **Fragmented Customer Data**: Customer information is scattered across multiple
   systems with no reliable way to identify the same customer across touchpoints.

1. **Duplicate Records**: Estimated 15-20% duplication rate in our master data creates
   operational inefficiencies and poor customer experiences.

1. **Limited Cross-Sell/Upsell Capability**: Inability to see complete customer
   relationships prevents effective targeting of additional products and services.

1. **Risk Management Gaps**: Incomplete visibility into entity relationships creates
   blind spots in fraud detection, KYC, and compliance efforts.

1. **Inefficient Manual Processes**: Data stewards spend approximately 30% of their time
   manually resolving entity matching issues.

1. **Analytics Limitations**: Disconnected data prevents accurate customer analytics,
   limiting our ability to derive actionable insights.

## Strategic Alignment

Implementing entity resolution aligns with our organization's strategic objectives:

| Strategic Objective    | Entity Resolution Contribution                                            |
